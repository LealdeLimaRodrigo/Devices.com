>Front-end: Angular 13

PART II (Answers)

1.	I prefer style #2 because it seems to be the user's view and gives a clearer view of what is needed, such as the number of devices. Also, the second style shows me the points I should address, not as a suggestion.
2.	I would give more information about how I want to see the information, breaking into more stories. Like “I want to see a list of devices with the corresponding status” and “I want to see details of a device”. Also, I would like to add priority and details about the devices.
3.	I would write unit tests, integration/functional tests and a performance test.
